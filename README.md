# List-App
A list creation application

## ABOUT
This is my first React.js project. React wise, with this project I delved into learning rendering, states, and the difference between function based rendering and class based rendering. For javascript, I practiced creating elements through javascript and manipulating/appending children of elements. The hardest part of the project for me was creating the "addList" function. This function helped me learn how to manipulate state arrays and How to control elements that are established in html and saved in an array. For example, when a list node element is created, I have its content saved in an array too. I was the able to attach a delete function that deletes the list node element along with the content thats saved in the array in that exact position.

### THINGS I WILL LOOK INTO TO IMPROVE MY CURRENT SKILLS
I know I need to look into keys and mapping. I understand that those methods could of made my project more simple. I will be looking into those now. I also have been told not to directly manipulate the DOM. I will keep that in mind for future projects and try to avoid that as best as possible.
